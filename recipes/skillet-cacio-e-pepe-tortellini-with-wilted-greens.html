    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How to make a quick-cooking pasta even quicker? Ditch the pot of boiling water! This 20-minute tortellini dinner comes together in a single skillet leaving you with less dishes to wash and more time to sit down and dig in. It’s inspired by the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe, whose creamy and richly pungent sauce is simply made with just two ingredients: salty Pecorino Romano cheese and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. </p>
    <p>Here, fresh or frozen tortellini cooks right in the skillet while the water it cooks in simmers into a starchy, glossy sauce. Tender wilted greens not only add color, but bulk up the pasta to turn it into a true one-pan dinner. This is a comforting, feel-good meal that’s fit for the busiest of weeknights. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 (8 to 9-ounce) packages fresh cheese tortellini, or 1 (16- to 20-ounce) bag frozen cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 ounces baby kale or spinach (about 3 packed cups)</li>

            <h3>Sear the tortellini:</h3>
            <p>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the tortellini in an even layer. Cook, tossing occasionally, until nicely browned in spots, 2 to 4 minutes.</p>
